Moore T.L.; Pesce C.; Greco A.; Pisante C.; Di Francesco V.; Decuzzi P.,,,A machine learning workflow to enhance microfluidic development of nanomedicines,2025,ChemRxiv,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,24,0,10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-2lb14,Preprint,Preprint,Self,1,1,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is being implemented in almost every facet of modern-day life, and machine learning, a subfield of AI, has the potential to greatly streamline the process of developing various nanomedicines using microfluidic fabrication techniques. The availability of open-source machine learning frameworks makes these powerful tools accessible to scientists, facilitating the integration of wet-bench activities with computational analysis. Here, we present a machine learning workflow aimed at optimizing the microfluidic formulation development of nanomedicines. A database of almost 200 unique nanomedicine formulations with over 550 total measurements was curated by producing liposomes, lipid nanoparticles, and PLGA nanoparticles using a benchtop microfluidic system. Microfluidic and materials input features, including the total flow rate, aqueous:organic flow rate ratio, and reagent concentrations, were systematically varied, and the resulting particles were characterized for their hydrodynamic diameter (dH ), polydispersity index (PdI), and encapsulation efficiency (EE) for a model therapeutic agent, curcumin (CURC). These data were used to train, test, and validate 13 different machine learning models with the task of returning the most accurate prediction of the nanomedicine attributes – dH , PdI, EE. The most accurate machine learning models, based on random forest regression, were implemented to provide the optimal formulation to yield particles with user-specified attributes. Finally, this system, dubbed MicrofluidicML, was compared against generative large language models as represented by the Open AI ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini platforms.The application of machine learning in the field of nanomedicine is inevitable, and MicrofluidicML represents a step towards implementing a machine learning framework towards accelerating formulation development."

Nanomedicines, despite their relatively large size compared to small molecules and nucleic acids, are being heavily investigated as vehicles to delivery therapeutics into the brain. Here we elaborate on how nanomedicines may be used to treat rare neurodevelopmental disorders, using Krabbe disease (globoid cell leukodystrophy) to frame the discussion. As a monogenetic disorder and lysosomal storage disease affecting the nervous system, the lessons learned from examining nanoparticle delivery to the brain in the context of Krabbe disease can have a broader impact on the treatment of various other neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we introduce the epidemiology and genetic basis of Krabbe disease, discuss current in vitro and in vivo models of the disease, as well as current therapeutic approaches either approved or at different stage of clinical developments. We then elaborate on challenges in particle delivery to the brain, with a specific emphasis on methods to transport nanomedicines across the blood–brain barrier. We highlight nanoparticles for delivering therapeutics for the treatment of lysosomal storage diseases, classified by the therapeutic payload, including gene therapy, enzyme replacement therapy, and small molecule delivery. Finally, we provide some useful hints on the design of nanomedicines for the treatment of rare neurological disorders."

Taking advantage of the unique physiology of the pulmonary circulation, here, micro-combinatorial hydrogel particles (µCGP) are realized via soft lithographic techniques to enhance the specific delivery of a cocktail of cytotoxic nanoparticles to metastatic foci. By cross-linking short poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains with erodible linkers within a shape-defining template, a deformable and biodegradable polymeric skeleton is realized and loaded with a variety of therapeutic and imaging agents, including docetaxel-nanoparticles. In a model of advanced breast cancer lung metastasis, µCGP amplified the colocalization of docetaxel-nanoparticles with pulmonary metastatic foci, prolonged the retention of chemotoxic molecules at the diseased site, suppressed lesion growth, and boosted survival beyond 20 weeks post nodule engraftment. The flexible design and modular architecture of µCGP would allow the efficient deployment of complex combination therapies in other vascular districts too, possibly addressing metastatic diseases of different origins."

The particles have a yolk-in-shell morphology, with a radioluminescent core, an upconverting shell, and a hollow region between the core and shell for loading drugs. They are synthesized by controlled encapsulation of a radioluminescent nanophosphor yolk in a silica shell, partial etching of the yolk in acid, and encapsulation of the silica with an upconverting luminescent shell. Metroxantrone, a chemotherapy drug, was loaded into the hollow space between X-ray phosphor yolk and up-conversion phosphor shell through pores in the shell. To encapsulate the drug and control the release rate, the nanoparticles are coated with pH-responsive biocompatible polyelectrolyte layers of charged hyaluronic acid sodium salt and chitosan. The nanophosphors display bright luminescence under X-ray, blue light (480 nm), and near infrared light (980 nm).

Ideally, a carbon-nanotube-based drug delivery system would exhibit low toxicity, sustained drug release, and persist in circulation without aggregation. Here, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) coated with a biocompatible block-co-polymer composed of poly(lactide)-poly(ethylene glycol) (PLA-PEG) are reported to reduce short-term and long-term toxicity, sustain drug release of paclitaxel (PTX), and prevent aggregation. The copolymer coating on the surface of CNTs significantly reduces in vitro toxicity. Moreover, the coating reduces the in vitro inflammatory response. Compared to non-coated CNTs, in vivo studies show no long-term inflammatory response with CNT coated with PLA-PEG (CLP) and the surface coating significantly decreases acute toxicity by doubling the maximum tolerated dose in mice. In vivo biodistribution and histology studies suggest a lower degree of aggregation in tissues."

Scientists have tuned the physico-chemical properties of these drug carriers to optimize their performance in biomedical/pharmaceutical applications. In particular, particle drug delivery systems at the micron size regime have been used since the 1980s. Recent advances in micro and nanofabrication techniques have enabled precise control of particle size and geometry–here we review the utility of microplates and discoidal polymeric particles for a range of pharmaceutical applications. Microplates are defined as micrometer scale polymeric local depot devices in cuboid form, while discoidal polymeric nanoconstructs are disk-shaped polymeric particles having a cross-sectional diameter in the micrometer range and a thickness in the hundreds of nanometer range. These versatile particles can be used to treat several pathologies such as cancer, inflammatory diseases and vascular diseases, by leveraging their size, shape, physical properties (e.g., stiffness), and component materials, to tune their functionality. This review highlights design and fabrication strategies for these particles, discusses their applications, and elaborates on emerging trends for their use in formulations."

When reporting results, it can be easy to overlook simple, seemingly trivial experimental details. In this context, we set out to understand how in vitro technique, specifically the way we administer particles in 2D culture, can influence experimental outcomes. Gold nanoparticles coated with poly(vinylpyrrolidone) were added to J774A.1 mouse monocyte/macrophage cultures as either a concentrated bolus, a bolus then mixed via aspiration, or pre-mixed in cell culture media. Particle-cell interaction was monitored via inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy and we found that particles administered in a concentrated dose interacted more with cells compared to the pre-mixed administration method. Spectroscopy studies reveal that the initial formation of the protein corona upon introduction to cell culture media may be responsible for the differences in particle-cell interaction. Modeling of particle deposition using the in vitro sedimentation, diffusion and dosimetry model helped to clarify what particle phenomena may be occurring at the cellular interface. We found that particle administration method in vitro has an effect on particle-cell interactions (i.e. cellular adsorption and uptake). Initial introduction of particles in to complex biological media has a lasting effect on the formation of the protein corona, which in turn mediates particle-cell interaction. It is of note that a minor detail, the way in which we administer particles in cell culture, can have a significant effect on what we observe regarding particle interactions in vitro."

However, it has recently been expanded for investigating the heating power of nanomaterials, such as superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). Here we implement LIT as a rapid and reproducible method that can evaluate the heating potential of various sizes of SPIONs under an alternating magnetic field (AMF), as well as the limits of detection for each particle size. SPIONs were synthesized via thermal decomposition and stabilized in water via a ligand transfer process. Thermographic measurements of SPIONs were made by stimulating particles of varying sizes and increasing concentrations under an AMF. Furthermore, a commercially available SPION sample was included as an external reference. While the size dependent heating efficiency of SPIONs has been previously described, our objective was to probe the sensitivity limits of LIT. For certain size regimes it was possible to detect signals at concentrations as low as 0.1 mg Fe/mL. Measuring at different concentrations enabled a linear regression analysis and extrapolation of the limit of detection for different size nanoparticles."

A promising approach to localizing drug release is to employ drug-loaded nanoparticles with coatings that release the drugs only in the presence of specific triggers found in the target cells such as pH, enzymes, or light. However, many parameters affect the nanoparticle distribution and drug release rate, and it is difficult to quantify drug release in situ. In this work, we show proof-of-principle for a “smart” radioluminescent nanocapsule with an X-ray excited optical luminescence (XEOL) spectrum that changes during release of the optically absorbing chemotherapy drug, doxorubicin. XEOL provides an almost background-free luminescent signal for measuring drug release from particles irradiated by a narrow X-ray beam. We study in vitro pH-triggered release rates of doxorubicin from nanocapsules coated with a pH-responsive polyelectrolyte multilayer using HPLC and XEOL spectroscopy. The doxorubicin was loaded to over 5% by weight and released from the capsule with a time constant in vitro of ∼36 days at pH 7.4 and 21 h at pH 5.0, respectively. The Gd2O2S:Eu nanocapsules are also paramagnetic at room temperature with similar magnetic susceptibility and similarly good MRI T2 relaxivities to Gd2O3, but the sulfur increases the radioluminescence intensity and shifts the spectrum. Empty nanocapsules did not affect cell viability up to concentrations of at least 250 μg/mL. These empty nanocapsules accumulated in a mouse liver and spleen following tail vein injection and could be observed in vivo using XEOL. The particles are synthesized with a versatile template synthesis technique which allows for control of particle size and shape.

This novel effort meets all functional criteria for a biomedical implant coating as it is chemically inert, atomically smooth and highly durable, with the potential for greatly enhancing the effectiveness of such implants. Specifically, graphene coatings on nitinol, a widely used implant and stent material, showed that graphene coated nitinol (Gr–NiTi) supports excellent smooth muscle and endothelial cell growth leading to better cell proliferation. The authors further determined that the serum albumin adsorption on Gr–NiTi is greater than that of fibrinogen, which is an important and well understood criterion for promoting a lower thrombosis rate. These hemo- and biocompatible properties, along with high strength, chemical inertness and durability provide graphene with an edge over most antithrombogenic coatings for biomedical implants and devices."

Nanomedicine uses nanoparticles with diameters in the range of ∼1–100 nm to encapsulate drugs and target them to tumors. The nanoparticle enhances local drug delivery efficiency to the tumors via entrapment in leaky tumor vasculature, molecular targeting to cells expressing cancer biomarkers, and/or magnetic targeting. In addition, the localization can be enhanced using triggered release in tumors via chemical, thermal, or optical signals. In order to optimize these nanoparticle drug delivery strategies, it is important to be able to image where the nanoparticles distribute and how rapidly they release their drug payloads.

Here, a ‘Tissue Chamber’ chip is designed and fabricated to study the extravascular transport of small molecules and nanoparticles. The chamber comprises a collagen slab, deposited within a PDMS mold, and an 800 μm channel for the injection of the working solution. Through fluorescent microscopy, the dynamics of molecules and nanoparticles was estimated within the gel, under different operating conditions. Diffusion coefficients were derived from the analysis of the particle mean square displacements (MSD). For validating the experimental apparatus and the protocol for data analysis, the diffusion D of FITC-Dextran molecules of 4, 40 and 250 kDa was first quantified. As expected, D reduces with the molecular weight of the dextran molecules. The MSD-derived diffusion coefficients were in good agreement with values derived via fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), an alternative technique that solely applies to small molecules. Then, the transport of six nanoparticles with similar hydrodynamic diameters (~ 200 nm) and different surface chemistries was quantified. Surface PEGylation was confirmed to favor the diffusion of nanoparticles within the collagen slab, whereas the surface decoration with hyaluronic acid (HA) chains reduced nanoparticle mobility in a way proportional to the HA molecular weight. To assess further the generality of the proposed approach, the diffusion of the six nanoparticles was also tested in freshly excised brain tissue slices. In these ex vivo experiments, the diffusion coefficients were 5-orders of magnitude smaller than for the Tissue Chamber chip. This was mostly ascribed to the lack of a cellular component in the chip. However, the trends documented for PEGylated and HA-coated nanoparticles in vitro were also confirmed ex vivo. This work demonstrates that the Tissue Chamber chip can be employed to effectively and efficiently test the extravascular transport of nanomedicines while minimizing the use of animals."

Similar to biodegradable polymeric scaffolds, the ideal nanomaterial remains stable for sufficient time to accomplish its desired task, and then rapidly degrades once that task is completed. Here, surface modifications are reported to accelerate iron oxide MNP degradation mediated by polymer encapsulation, in which iodegradable coatings composed of FDA approved polymers with different degradation rates are used: poly(lactide) (PLA) or copolymer poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA). Results demonstrate that degradation of MNPs can be controlled by varying the content and composition of the polymeric nanoparticles used for MNP encapsulation (PolyMNPs). Incorporated into cellular spheroids, PolyMNPs maintain a high viability compared to non-coated MNPs, and are also useful in magnetically patterning cellular spheroids into fused tissues for tissue engineering applications. Accelerated degradation compared to non-coated MNPs makes PolyMNPs a viable alternative for removing nanomaterials from tissues after accomplishing their desired role."

Here, we assessed the tribological properties of a simulated synovial fluid enriched with non-spherical, poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) microparticles (µPL) that have been previously demonstrated for the pharmacological management of osteoarthritis (OA). Three different µPL configurations were fabricated presenting a 20 µm × 20 µm square base and a thickness of 5 µm (thin, 5H µPL), 10 µm (10H µPL), and 20 µm (cubical, 20H µPL). After extensive morphological and physicochemical characterizations, the apparent Young’s modulus of the µPL was quantified under compressive loading returning an average value of ∼ 6 kPa, independently of the particle morphology. Then, using a linear two-axis tribometer, the static (µs) and dynamic (µd) friction coefficients of the µPL-enriched simulated synovial fluid were determined in terms of particle configuration and concentration, varying from 0 (fluid only) to 6µ105 µPL/mL. The particle morphology had a modest influence on friction, possibly because the µPL were fully squeezed between two mating surfaces by a 5.8 N normal load realizing boundary-like lubrication conditions. Differently, friction was observed to depend on the dimensionless parameter Ω, defined as the ratio between the total volume of the µPL enriching the simulated synovial fluid and the volume of the fluid itself. Both coefficients of friction were documented to grow with Ω reaching a plateau of µs ∼ 0.4 and µd ∼ 0.15, already at Ω ∼ 2×10−3. Future investigations will have to systematically analyze the effect of sliding velocity, normal load, and rigidity of the mating surfaces to elucidate in full the tribological behavior of µPL in the context of osteoarthritis."

A biodegradable, biocompatible poly(lactide) (PLA) coating enables encapsulation and controlled release of the hydrophobic anticancer drug paclitaxel (PTX), and a hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) shell increases the solubility of the nGr drug delivery system.

By using a particle model, key contributing factors underlying cell adhesion on nonporous silica particle surfaces, migration and engulfment, are simulated and studied. Following a 24 h incubation period, monocyte-derived macrophages and A549 epithelial cells are able to adhere and remove particles in their local vicinity through induction of adhesive pulling arise from cell traction forces and phagocytic/endocytic mechanisms, in a size-dependent manner. It is observed that such particle-decorated surfaces can be used to address the influence of surface topography on cell behavior. Substrates which presented 480 nm silica particles are able to induce greater development and maturation of focal adhesions, which play an important role in cellular mechanoregulation. Moreover, under a chemotactic influence, in the presence of 30% fetal bovine serum, macrophages are able to uptake the particles and be directed to translocate along a concentration gradient, indicating that local mechanical effects do not substantially impair normal physiological functions."

It is becoming increasingly evident that merely controlling particle physicochemical properties may not be sufficient to mediate particle biodistribution in dynamic environments. Thus, researchers are increasingly turning toward more complex but likewise more physiological in vitro systems to study particle–-cell/particle–system interactions. An emerging paradigm is to utilize naturally migratory cells to act as so-called “Trojan horses” or cellular shuttles. We report here the use of monocytes/macrophages to transport NP across a confluent endothelial cell layer using a microfluidic in vitro model. With a custom-built flow chamber, we showed that physiological shear stress, when compared to low flow or static conditions, increased NP uptake by macrophages. We further provided a mathematical explanation for the effect of flow on NP uptake, namely that the physical exposure times of NP to cells is dictated by shear stress (i.e., flow rate) and results in increased particle uptake under flow. This study was extended to a multicellular, hydrodynamic in vitro model. Because monocytes are cells that naturally translocate across biological barriers, we utilized a monocyte/macrophage cell line as cellular NP transporters across an endothelial layer. In this exploratory study, we showed that monocyte/macrophage cells adhere to an endothelial layer and dynamically interact with the endothelial cells. The monocytes/macrophages took up NP and diapedesed across the endothelial layer with NP accumulating within the cellular uropod. These data illustrate that monocytes/macrophages may therefore act as active shuttles to deliver particles across endothelial barriers."

For these bioimaging applications, the nanophosphors should ideally be small, monodispersed and brightly luminescent. However, most methods used to improve luminescence yield by annealing the particles to reduce crystal and surface defects (e.g. using flux or sintering agents) also cause particle fusion or require multiple component core–shell structures. Here, we report a novel method to prepare bright, uniformly sized X-ray nanophosphors (Gd2O2S:Eu or Tb) and upconversion nanophosphors (Y2O2S:Yb/Er, or Yb/Tm) with large crystal domain size without causing aggregation. A core–shell nanoparticle is formed, with NaF only in the core. We observe that increasing the NaF sintering agent concentration up to 7.6 mol% increases both crystal domain size and luminescence intensity (up to 40% of commercial microphosphors) without affecting the physical particle diameter. Above 7.6 mol%, particle fusion is observed. The annealing is insensitive to the cation (Na+ or K+) but varies strongly with anion, with F− > Cl− > CO32− > Br− > I−. The luminescence depends strongly on crystal domain size. The data agree reasonably well with a simple domain surface quenching model, although the size-dependence suggests additional quenching mechanisms within small domains. The prepared bright nanophosphors were subsequently functionalized with PEG–folic acid to target MCF-7 breast cancer cells which overexpress folic acid receptors. Both X-ray and upconversion nanophosphors provided low background and bright luminescence which was imaged through 1 cm chicken breast tissue at a low dose of nanophosphors 200 μL (0.1 mg mL−1). We anticipate these highly monodispersed and bright X-ray and upconversion nanophosphors will have significant potential for tumor targeted imaging."

While the successes of spherical lipid-based nanoparticles have heralded marked changes in chemotherapy worldwide, the history of asbestos-induced lung disease casts a long shadow over fibrous materials to date. The impact of particle morphology is known to be intertwined with many physicochemical parameters, namely, size, elasticity, surface chemistry, and biopersistence. In this review, we first highlight some of the morphologies observed in nature as well as shapes available to us through synthetic strategies. Following this we discuss attempts to understand the cellular uptake of nanoparticles through various theoretical models before comparing this with observations from in vitro and in vivo experiments. In addition, we consider the impact of nanoparticle shape at different size regimes on targeting, cytotoxicity, and cellular mechanics."

The synthetized substrates are obtained with a facile and reproducible method from poly-N-isopropylacrylamide and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles.

In fact, poly(α-hydroxy acids) such as polylactide (PLA), poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), and poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) have been heavily researched in the past three decades as the material basis of polymeric NPs for drug delivery applications. As materials, these polymers have found success in resorbable sutures, biodegradable implants, and even monolithic, biodegradable platforms for sustained release of therapeutics (e.g., proteins and small molecules) and diagnostics. Few fields have gained more attention in drug delivery through polymeric NPs than cancer therapy. However, the clinical translational of polymeric nanomedicines for treating solid tumors has not been congruent with the fervor or funding in this particular field of research. Here, we attempt to provide a comprehensive snapshot of polyester NPs in the context of chemotherapeutic delivery. This includes a preliminary exploration of the polymeric nanomedicine in the cancer research space. We examine the various processes for producing polyester NPs, including methods for surface-functionalization, and related challenges. After a detailed overview of the multiple factors involved with the delivery of NPs to solid tumors, the crosstalk between particle design and interactions with biological systems is discussed. Finally, we report state-of-the-art approaches toward effective delivery of NPs to tumors, aiming at identifying new research areas and re-evaluating the reasons why some research avenues have underdelivered. We hope our effort will contribute to a better understanding of the gap to fill and delineate the future research work needed to bring polyester-based NPs closer to clinical application."

Although different techniques are available to quantify the bulk stiffness in static conditions, there is still uncertainty in assessing particle deformability in dynamic conditions. Here, a microfluidic chip is designed, engineered, and validated as a platform to assess the mechanical behavior of fluid-borne particles. Specifically, potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet etching was used to realize a channel incorporating a series of micropillars (filtering modules) with different geometries and openings, acting as microfilters in the direction of the flow. These filtering modules were designed with progressively decreasing openings, ranging in size from about 5 down to 1 μm. Discoidal polymeric nanoconstructs (DPNs), with a diameter of 5.5 μm and a height of 400 nm, were realized with different poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) ratios (PLGA/PEG), namely, 5:1 and 1:0, resulting in soft and rigid particles, respectively. Given the peculiar geometry of DPNs, the channel height was kept to 5 μm to limit particle tumbling or flipping along the flow. After thorough physicochemical and morphological characterization, DPNs were tested within the microfluidic chip to investigate their behavior under flow. As expected, most rigid DPNs were trapped in the first series of pillars, whereas soft DPNs were observed to cross multiple filtering modules and reach the micropillars with the smallest opening (1 μm). This experimental evidence was also supported by computational tools, where DPNs were modeled as a network of springs and beads immersed in a Newtonian fluid using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. This preliminary study presents a combined experimental–computational framework to quantify, compare, and analyze the characteristics of particles having complex geometrical and mechanical attributes under flow conditions."

Particles with a diameter of 1, 2, and 5 μm are fabricated with a lithographic templating technique, and used to stabilize medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil emulsions. Three phase contact angles decreased from 85° ± 7° to 68° ± 12° moving from 1 to 5 μm DPN stabilized emulsions, showing a particle “hydrophilicity” increase with size. Microscopy imaging showed that the mean droplet diameter and dispersity increased with particle size, and that DPNs were present at the oil–water interface. DPN based emulsions were stable for about 24 h or less in the case of 1 and 2 μm DPNs. Emulsion stability was shorter than 12 h in case of 5 μm DPNs. Finally, calculations of DPN detachment free energies ΔGdw and excess surface coverages Cexcess demonstrated that, despite the significantly high adhesion energy of the discoidal DPN, emulsion stability was mostly affected by gravitational forces for DPN sizes above 2 μm. The use of PLGA and MCT oil in this study is relevant for future use of Pickering emulsions in pharmaceutical and drug delivery applications."

Four specific poly(vinyl alcohol-co-N-vinylamine) copolymers are synthesized containing primary, secondary, or tertiary amines. Particle cellular association (i.e., cellular uptake and surface adsorption), as well as protein corona composition, are then investigated. It is found that the protein corona (as a consequence of “amine bulkiness”) and amine density are both important in dictating cellular association. By evaluating the nanoparticle surface chemistry and the protein fingerprint, proteins that are significant in mediating particle–cell association are identified. In particular, primary amines, when exposed on the polymer side chain, are strongly correlated with the presence of alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein, and promote nanoparticle cellular association."

While it is well understood that nanoparticle (NP) physico-chemical properties can dictate biological responses and interactions, it has been difficult to outline a unifying framework to directly link NP properties to expected in vitro and in vivo outcomes. When introduced to complex biological media containing electrolytes, proteins, lipids, etc., nanoparticles (NPs) are subjected to a range of forces which determine their behavior in this environment. One aspect of NP behavior in biological systems that is often understated or overlooked is aggregation. NP aggregation will significantly alter in vitro behavior (dosimetry, NP uptake, cytotoxicity), as well as in vivo fate (pharmacokinetics, toxicity, biodistribution). Thus, understanding the factors driving NP colloidal stability and aggregation is paramount. Furthermore, studying biological interactions with NPs at the nanoscale level requires an interdisciplinary effort with a robust understanding of multiple characterization techniques.

X-ray luminescence tomography (XLT) maps the location of these radioluminescent contrast agents at high resolution by scanning a narrow X-ray beam through the tissue sample and collecting the luminescence at every position. Adding magnetic functionality to these radioluminescent particles would enable them to be guided, oriented, and heated using external magnetic fields, while their location and spectrum could be imaged with XLT and complementary magnetic resonance imaging. In this work, multifunctional monodispersed magnetic radioluminescent nanoparticles were developed as potential drug delivery carriers and radioluminescence imaging agents. The particles consisted of a spindle-shaped magnetic γ-Fe2O3 core and a radioluminescent europium-doped gadolinium oxide shell. Particles with solid iron oxide cores displayed saturation magnetizations consistent with their ∼13% core volume, however, the iron oxide quenched their luminescence. In order to increase the luminescence, we partially etched the iron oxide core in oxalic acid while preserving the radioluminescent shell. The core size was controlled by the etching time which in turn affected the particles' luminescence and magnetic properties. Particles with intermediate core sizes displayed both strong magnetophoresis and luminescence properties. They also served as MRI contrast agents with relaxivities of up to 58 mM−1 s−1 (r2) and 120 mM−1 s−1 (r2*). These particles offer promising multimodal MRI/fluorescence/X-ray luminescence contrast agents. Our core–shell synthesis technique offers a flexible method to control particle size, shape, and composition for a wide range of biological applications of magnetic/luminescent nanoparticles."
